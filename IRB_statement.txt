Statement regarding IRB Documentation:

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) documentation for this research is available. However, as this documentation explicitly names our institution, providing it directly at this stage could compromise the double-blind review process. Should the reviewers or the program committee require verification of IRB approval, we are prepared to submit the complete IRB documentation directly to the Ethics Area Chair upon request.
